# ricktaps unRAID Docker Templates

Hi, this is the place to get all of my unRAID Docker templates.
Not all of the images are written by me - in those cases I just added the
template to make it easier for others, that just want to enjoy those images
provided through the docker hub.

## Applications

* minecraft
* icinga (in the making)

## Usage
1. Open the **Docker** tab in your unRAID 6.0 (or newer) WebUI and navigate to the "Docker Repositories" sub-tab.
2. Add the URL of (this repository)(https://github.com/ricktap/unraid-docker-templates) in to "Template repositories"
3. Click "Save" - enjoy!
